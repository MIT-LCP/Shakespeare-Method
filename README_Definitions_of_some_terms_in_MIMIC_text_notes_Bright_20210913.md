While reading many MIMIC records and isolated n-grams (n from 1 to 5) as part of the 
Shakespeare project, I came across many terms unfamiliar to me. I have some medical 
knowledge, although I am not a clinician. I started a file of terms, definitions, and 
references. Most of them are not standard terms available in standard sources such as 
UMLS and many of the definitions were difficult to find. This list is a start because 
I was filling in my own gaps in knowledge and addressing what I encountered in the 
clinical notes; I did not attempt to be comprehensive. Nonetheless, this contribution 
could be useful to people in a similar position as mine.

The file has four fields: Defined term, Definition, Reference1, and Reference2. If 
more than one meaning was found for a defined term (this happened many times), there is 
a separate entry for each. Definitions are in the form of a phrase or one or more 
complete sentences. Up to two references are allowed for each entry. References are a 
mix of books and online addresses.

I recommend reading the book by Laurence M. Deutsch (Medical Records for Attorneys, 
ALI-ABA 2001) for an introduction to clinical records for non-clinicians. In addition 
to the resources listed in the file, I found some other useful references:

- [Liver function tests](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-function-tests/
about/pac-20394595).

- [Normal hemodynamic values](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/

- [Laboratory tests](https://www.nurseslearning.com/courses/nrp/labtest/course/section8/

I hope this file will grow with additions and corrections.
