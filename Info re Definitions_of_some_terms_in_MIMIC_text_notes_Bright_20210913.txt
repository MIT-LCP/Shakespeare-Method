Definitions_of_some_terms_in_MIMIC_text_notes_Bright_20210913

While reading many MIMIC records and isolated n-grams (n from 1 to 5) as part of the Shakespeare project, I came across many terms unfamiliar to me. 

I am not a clinician but do have some medical knowledge. I recommend reading the Deutsch book (Medical records for attorneys. ALI-ABA 2001.) for an introduction to clinical records for nonclinicians. I started a file of terms, definitions, and references. Most of them are not standard terms available in standard sources such as UMLS. Many of the definitions were difficult to find. 

This list is a start because I was filling in my own gaps in knowledge and addressing what I encountered; I did not attempt to be comprehensive. Nonetheless, this contribution could be useful to people in a similar position as mine.

I hope this file will form the basis for a growing file that reflects additions and corrections.

The file has four fields: Defined term, Definition, Reference1, and Reference2. If more than one meaning was found for a defined term (this happened many times), there is a separate entry for each. Definitions are in the form of a phrase or one or more complete sentences. Up to two references are allowed for each entry. References are a mix of books and online addresses.

In addition to the above file, I found some other useful references:
    - Liver function tests. https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-function-tests/about/pac-20394595.

    - Normal hemodynamic values. http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/surgery/education/GrandRounds/Documents/GRpdfs/2010%20-%202011/Aug%209%20Shock-Hemodynamics-Monitoring%20Goldberg.pdf.
